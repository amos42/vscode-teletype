# VS Code Extension with Teletype Libraries (Development in Progress)
This repository is for the VS Code extension with Teletype libraries. This extension can be executed in Eclipse Che sidecar as a remote plugin. The aim of this extension is to implement the CoEditing skeleton for Eclipse Che and Theia so that contributors can have the experience similar to Google Docs. This skeleton can be further used for mentoring sessions, code reviews, and co-editing.
